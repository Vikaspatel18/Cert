<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I still couldnâ€™t believe that I passed Sec+ with 772 on my first try.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">To be honest, I wouldn't say it's simple because there are some questions in the exam that need more than one minute to think about and answer. I really felt like I wasn't going to finish this because I messed up in the pbqs and I just had a half hour left for the pbqs. So I was a little scared at the time since I had to go over the marked questions as well.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">My honest suggestion to candidates is to look through the comptia objectives and jot down whatever information you know about that specific topic and everything you don't know, simply listen to Professor Messers videos. Rather than reading his course materials, I would advise you to simply listen to what he is saying and write it down in your own words.Â Trust me guys it will help you alot.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Simply print the objectives and make the flashcard/sticky notes or use an Ipad to do so to make things easier. One module will take one full day to finish. and then read and review what you wrote over there the next day. You'll cover everything in the objectives this way. I used this way and trust me it helped me alot.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I also used Professor Messer's examinations, Jason Dion's exams, and the Comptia Sec+ App (With the globe and red background)</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">I would suggest to do the Messers exam, write it down, then go over each and every question over there and revise it, he gave the video link along with the questions as well.I wouldnâ€™t recommend to use JD's exams, because it's somewhat difficult and the questions were somewhat lengthy.In addition, the sec+ app has module-by-module questions, making it ideal for on-the-go study.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Other than that, Dions' course is adequate for good understanding, although it has a lot of irrelevant information that you donâ€™t need to know for sec+, but knowledge is invaluable.I majorly used Professor messer's youtube videos and that helped me to pass the exams.</h5>
<h5 class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">Thats it!!!</h5>
